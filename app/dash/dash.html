<h3 id="about">About the Tricktionary</h3>
<p>
  The sport of competitive jump roping is a continually growing international
  community of some of the world's most talented athletes. This app aims to help
  anyone hoping to become involved in this phenomenal sport by giving anyone with
  a phone the power to learn all levels and types of jump rope skills. The
  Tricktionary is organized by type (Basics, Multiples, Power, Rope Manipulation,
  and Releases) and by level (1-4). It provides a description, a video,
  prerequisites, and what to learn next for each trick.

  A new and powerful tool included in The Jump Rope Tricktionary is the speed
  timer. With this tool you can time and click speed and be provided with useful
  statistics about the event. The app displays score, speed, number of misses, an
  estimated score assuming no misses occurred, and a graph of the jumpers
  instantaneous speed throughout the entire event.
</p>
<p>
  Also included in the Android&trade; app is the Show Writer. This enables coaches
  and jumpers to quickly write jump rope shows in which each athlete has the
  maximum amount of break time between each of their routines.
</p>
<p>

<h3 id="booklets">the Tricktionary booklet</h3>
<p>
  the Tricktionary is avilable as a printable booklet. The booklet contains all
  tricks listed on the site as well as four speed protocols. We strongly reccomend
  printing double sided, else you'll have to manually glue the sides together.
</p>
<p>
  <label>Booklet language:
    <select ng-model="booklet.lang">
      <option ng-repeat="(lang, val) in booklets" ng-value="lang">{{ langs[lang] }}</option>

<h3 id="rafiki">The Rafiki Outreach Program</h3>
<p>
  the Tricktionary is a proud supporter of the Rafiki Outreach Program, read more
  about it

</p>
<h3 id="levels">Explanation of Levels</h3>
<p>
  A checkmark (<i class="fa fa-check gray"></i>) beside a trick's level means thatthe level has been verified by a certified judge. A golden checkmark (<i class="fa fa-check gold"></i>) means that the trick's level has been verified by a federation official.
</p>
<p>
  On some occurrences you might notice levels with a dash between two or more
  numbers, this means that the trick is actually a composition of multiple tricks,
  the first digit is the level of the first occuring trick followed by a dash and
  the level of the second trick, and so on.
</p>
<p>
  A typical example of this is a standard
  <a href="/details/1/8">Pushup</a>
  which in fisac-irsf's rulebook is split into two separate tricks, one where you
  jump into the pushup, and one when you jump out from it.
</p>
<p>
  To report an error in the data, either press "Report an issue with this trick"
  on the trick's page, or see the
  <a ng-href="/contact">Contact</a>
  page.
