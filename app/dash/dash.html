<h3>Explanation of Levels</h3>
<p>
    On some occurrences you might notice levels with a dash between two or more numbers,
    this means that the trick is actually a composition of multiple tricks,
    the first digit is the level of the first occuring trick followed by a dash and the level of the second trick,
    and so on.
</p>
<p>
    A typical example of this is a sandard <a href="/details/1/8">Pushup</a> which in fisac-irsf's rulebook is split
    into two separate tricks, one where you jump into the pushup, and one when you jump out from it.
